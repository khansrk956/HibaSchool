                  maintain a close rapport with the teachers teaching their
                  wards in the school. For this reason, Open Houses are
                  organised from time to time. In case you need to meet any
                  Teacher, the Headmistress, Vice Principal or Principal outside
                  the Open House schedule, you are requested to take prior
                  appointment. You may also write your concerns at

                  ABSENTEEISM: Parents should intimate the school when the
                  student is absent from school stating the reasons for absence
                  through email/student portal. Students who have been sick
                  should upload a medical certificate. Students who require
                  medical attention during school hours, will be sent by the
                  teachers to the school clinic with a written note. Repeated
                  absence without leave or unexplained absence for six
                  consecutive working days renders a student liable to having
                  his/her name struck off the rolls without any notice.
                  Re-admission may be granted after payment of a fresh admission
                  fee, only at the discretion of the Principal. All students are
                  expected to attend school on the opening day after the
                  vacations. It is compulsory for the students to complete 75%
                  of the attendance in the year to make them eligible to sit for
                  the final examination. It would be appreciated if students
                  have an average of at least 90% attendance before the
                  examination.
